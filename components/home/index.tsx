      My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (
      <Alt>HCI</Alt>
      ), responsible artificial intelligence (<Alt>R/AI</Alt>
      ), and digital health equity. I design, build, and evaluate sociotechnical
      systems that enable positive social transformation for underserved
      communities. Specifically, my work centers on computing in high-stakes
      healthcare settings, with an aim at addressing how social determinants of
      health contribute to inequities faced by community and home healthcare
      workers.
