      My research interests are in human-computer interaction (<Alt>HCI</Alt>
      ), information and communication technologies for development (
      <Alt>ICTD</Alt>), and responsible artificial intelligence (<Alt>R/AI</Alt>
      ). I work on designing, building, and evaluating sociotechnical systems
      that enable positive social transformation for underserved communities. My
      research focuses on intractable yet critical problems related to computing
      in high-stakes healthcare settings &mdash; particularly with respect to
      social determinants of health for community and home health workers.
