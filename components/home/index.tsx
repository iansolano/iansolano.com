      My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (
      <Alt>HCI</Alt>
      ), responsible artificial intelligence (<Alt>R/AI</Alt>
      ), and digital health equity. I design, build, and evaluate sociotechnical
      systems that enable positive social transformation for underserved
      communities. Specifically, my work centers on computing in high-stakes
      healthcare settings, with a particular focus on developing novel AI and
      data-driven systems to support formal and informal caregivers and the
      older adults they care for.
