      ), information and communication technologies for development (
      <Alt>ICTD</Alt>), and machine learning for social good (<Alt>ML4SG</Alt>).
      My research focus is on building and evaluating computing technologies
      that aim to improve the lives of marginalized and underserved populations.
      In particular, I am interested in community and in-home healthcare, mental
      health, climate resilience, and responsible artificial intelligence.
